# 📘 Data Analysis Practical – README

This repository contains the solutions and code for the **Data Analysis Practical** completed using **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**.
Synthetic datasets with NaN values are generated using NumPy and Pandas, and all tasks follow the instructions given in the assignment.

---

## 📂 Contents of the Repository

### **1️⃣ Practical Notebook**

* Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) containing:

  * Synthetic data creation
  * Handling missing values
  * Mean, median, weighted mean
  * Z-score standardization & outlier detection
  * Age binning and statistical summaries
  * NumPy operations (shape, resize, transpose, broadcasting, dot product, linear algebra)

---

### **2️⃣ Synthetic Dataset**

* Dataset created using NumPy & Pandas
* Includes:

  * Age
  * Income
  * Missing (NaN) values introduced randomly
  * Reproducible using `random_seed = 42`

---

### **3️⃣ Outputs & Explanation**

* Step-by-step code with clear comments
* Tables and DataFrames for results
* Explanation for:

  * Why weighted means are needed
  * How outliers are detected using |z| > 3
  * How age bins improve data grouping
  * NumPy multidimensional operations

---

## 🧪 Practical Tasks Summary

### ✔️ **Problem 1: Basic Statistics**

* Mean and median of income
* Age-weighted mean of income
* Ignoring NaN values correctly

### ✔️ **Problem 2: Z-Score Standardization**

* Computing z-scores for income
* Identifying outliers where |z| > 3
* Handling NaNs without dropping full rows

### ✔️ **Problem 3: Age Binning**

Age ranges used:

* **18–25**
* **25–35**
* **35–45**
* **45–60**

For each bin:

* Count
* Mean income
* Median income

Result displayed as a tidy DataFrame.

### ✔️ **Problem 4: NumPy Operations**

Performed on a **multi-dimensional array**:

* Shape, size, transpose, flatten
* Negative indexing and slicing errors demonstration
* Broadcasting
* Dot product
* Determinant & matrix inverse
